There is a problem. I downloaded the "C++ JOYSTICK" to my laptop, opend the 'Test1' project with Visual studio 2012.
I tried to build it, but this message showed up:
" 1>------ Build started: Project: Test1, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------
1>Project file contains ToolsVersion="12.0". This toolset is unknown or missing. You may be able to resolve this by installing the appropriate .NET Framework for this toolset. Treating the project as if it had ToolsVersion="4.0".

To build using the v120 build tools, either click the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then select "Update VC++ Projects...". Install v120 to build using the v120 build tools.
